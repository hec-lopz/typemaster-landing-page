## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Stylus](https://github.com/stylus/stylus/tree/dev/docs)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- Responsive Web Design
- HTML Resposive images
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/)

### What I learned

At the beggining I thought of doing the hero section with CSS grid, however I decided that using it could require more code and time spent in order to have it properly positioned. I chose to use CSS flexbox instead, as there are no repetitive items in this section, grid's functionalities would not be missed.

I tried my best on organizing my files the best possible, on a way I imagine a bigger project would use. Styles files are divided by section and each section has separated media queries. I also used BEM for naming my classes, which made my stylus files to be easier to read.

I decided to use webpack in order to optimize the project, despite I donÂ´t use much JavaScript I still can take advantage of its ability to process images and files.

### Continued development

I would like to improve semantic HTML, also I would like to learn more about accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [BEM: la mejor manera de nombrar tus clases de HTML](https://platzi.com/tutoriales/2008-html-css/7858-bem-la-mejor-manera-de-nombrar-tus-clases-de-html/) - This is an article I wrote about how to implement BEM, this is the thinking process I make to name my classes.
- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-properties) - This is the resource I check everytime I have to use Flexbox.
- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Same case for CSS Grid.
